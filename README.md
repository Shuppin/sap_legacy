# The SAP (Simple As Possible) Programming Language version 1.0

**Note:** SAP v2.0 is currently in the works and will be released at some point.

This is the source code repository for the original SAP programming language and exists for archival purposes. It is quite messy as I didn't really intend for this to go public. Furthermore, the documentation is very limited, only consisting of these readme files and comments within the code itself.

This was my first deep dive into language implementation and is not desinged to be used as an actual language. The original intent of this project was too see if I was simply capable of making it, and I would say that intent has been fulfilled.

Please see `INFO.md` for more detailed information about the language.
